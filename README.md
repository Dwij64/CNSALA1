CryptoLock Messenger is a secure web-based messaging application developed as part of ALA-1 activity. It implements a hybrid encryption system combining:
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) – Symmetric encryption for securing the message content.
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) – Asymmetric encryption for safely transmitting the AES key.
